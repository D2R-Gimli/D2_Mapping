############################
How to make it work to test:
############################
0. Tools needed/used:
	Notepad++
	AFJ Sheet 0.61 Beta
	This is a good source: https://d2mods.info/forum/viewtopic.php?p=459545#459545
	

1. Copy over the files (ds1 map and dt1 tiles) to your gamedir:
	-> data/global/tiles/expansion/map/YOURMAPNAME.ds1
	-> data/global/tiles/PD2assets/Torturehalls/YOURTILESET-FILES.dt1 (only the ones that are different from original game!)

2. Extract from pd2data.mpq the files from data/global/excel:
	Levels.txt
	LvlMaze.txt
	LvlPrest.txt
	LvlTypes.txt
	Objects.txt (used for the editor)

3. Open LvlTypes.txt with sheet editor
	Go to line #35 "Act 5 - Temple" (which was the base for the map)
	Add the additional tiles used for the map in "File2" "File3",.. from left to right, like:
	Expansion/wildtemple/interior.dt1	Expansion/town/trees.dt1 	PD2assets/Torturehalls/a5_torture.dt1	PD2assets/Torturehalls/torturehalls.dt1
	Make a count, how many files are used! (here = 4 tiles) -> Needed for later calculations!
	#HOW-TO CALC: Run "DT1-Calc.exe" and mark the checkboxes like you are using one or more titles in columns File1, File2,.. etc.
	In my case, i have 4 titles (File 1, 2, 3, 4) -> activate 1,2,3,4 in DT1-Calc and press "Calculate Mask" --> 15 is the value we will be using later.
	Save file
	
4. Open LvlPrest.txt with Notepad and go to line #1052 "Act 5 - Temple NE Waypoint" (1049)
	Copy the line and add it to the very end of the file and save it.
	Open LvlPrest.txt with sheet editor
	Change the name to the new map "TortureHalls" for example
	Def= the last index number. If the pre lasting entry was 1146 you have 1147 now on the new map. (upfollowing numbers)
	LevelID = 122 (which is "Act 5 - Temple 1" from Levels.txt)
	Make sure in Levels.txt that the selected area has the right LevelType = 32 (in my case)
	Set "KillEdge" = 0 to avoid missing walls or such later on the game if you have set them to the outermost place in the new map.
	SizeX and SizeY should be 0
	Pops should be 0 (unless you use this)
	Files should be 1 (for a single static map layout). If you have more layouts for the map, use the amount of variation-layouts here.
	"File1" should be changed to the new map dir -> Expansion/Map/TortureHalls.ds1
	"Dt1Mask" needs to be calculated based on the amount of used titles. (In my case here 4 title = 15)
	Save file
	
5. Open Levels.txt with sheet editor and jump to line #125 (Act 5 - Temple 1) with the ID=122
	Change the SizeX and SizeY to your new map (125x125 in my case)
	Adjust the OffsetX and OffsetY if you need to (when shared with other maps) and you encount any problems.
	"DrawEdges"=1 -> dunno if this helps?
	"IsInside"=1 if you have an kind of "inside something" map and not an open world outside.
	"DrlgType"=2 (REQUIRED if you wanna use a static/preset map and not a 'Maze' style map with auto-generation).
	"LevelType"=32 (this refers to LvlTypes.txt and the used DT1 tiles.)
	Vis0/Vis1 should be set to 0
	Warp0/Warp1 should be set to -1
	"Intensity" = 30 (from 1) no clue - lightning correction?!
	MonLvl will adjust the values - depending if you want a T1, T2, T3, T4 map
	MonDen can be adjusted, based on the required Monster Density you wish in your map.
	"MonUMin" and "MonUMax" values can be adjusted how many Monsters you want.
	"mon1" etc. can be adjusted to the wished monster types in your map.
	"Waypoint" is set to "35" (which we will be using for testing this map ingame)
	Make sure to see the original "35" and chage this value to 255 to "deactivate" it.
	"LevelName" is the name of your new map (TortureHalls)
	"LevelWarp" is the highlight name if you have a warp tile used or such
	"EntryFile" should be changed to a value that is not in use by other stuff (like M99L1)
		This is the DC6 graphic file the displays ‘Entering [wherever]’ when you go into a new area. We will create this file later.
	
	Save file
	
6. Now copy over all the text files to your game dir ProjectD2/data/global/excel
	Make sure, there are no ".bin" files in there (maybe use a batch script to delete them all)
	Try run the game (Diablo2 shortcut with -w -direct -txt) or PlugY with -direct -txt parameters set
	Test the map for your needs and keep adjusting them in the editor as you like it.
	
7. If you are finished with the map --> Ask Senpai or the other Dev's how to implement this in a correct and good way into the game.

Happy mapping!
