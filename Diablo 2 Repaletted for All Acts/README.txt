All .dt1 files able to were extracted with Paul Siramy's DT1 Tools.

I then ran all the .pcx files through a photoshop batch action I created (20 actions technically, one for each acts 4 palette shifts).

These scripts loaded a modified colour table with a fix for colour 54 and 256 being identical, then swapping to RGB colour mode, then back to indexed to the source destination's palette with the same colour fix.

I then created all the dt1's again using DT1 Tools.

Index values should all be the same as the source. You should be able to load these into existing ds1's with force dt1 or editing a lvltype file, and choosing a different act's palette, or using them in your own maps.

Some tiles may not be able to look great in certain acts due to colour restrictions. Nothing we can do about that unless I spend time shifting those colours to something else manually, which would change the feel and take a lot more effort than running my scripts. If you have a special request, I'm usually pretty open to breaking out photoshop to help in any way I can.


You can choose files individually on google drive, or click the download button from the dropdown near the top for everything.

If anything seems wrong, feel free to hit me up on discord at mubbsy#2369 and I can fix it. I am human and may have made errors ;)

Enjoy!
